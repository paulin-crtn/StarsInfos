# StarsInfos

This is a simple CRUD project asked by a recruiter in order to test my skills on the Laravel framework. I used some built-in tools like Model, View, Controller, Request, Session (for flashing messages) and Storage (for uploading files).

## Database

Import the provided database (starsinfos.sql) via phpMyAdmin or any other tool (don't create a database, it will be created automatically when uploaded).
